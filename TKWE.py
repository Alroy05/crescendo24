review = """ Item is very use full and i liked this product Very good Good one Good Going to use it twice a week after brushing only after dinner, as it contains -OH. Overall, a steal deal. Great. On time It is better than any other mouthwash Very nice product 4.0 out of 5 stars It cause burning sensation but it is effective. Good test and cool mint. Getting fresh energy after mouth wash. effective but very strong burning taste Works well. Good Good for dental problems and related problems. nan Original product. Good to use and effective It good for rinsing teeth before sleep. You can use it after drink and it will hide the alcoholic smell . It's very much acrid in taste. For me 'mild taste' flavour bottles are far better than these. Taste is differ Like Good to use twice weekly.Of you use daily there might be chance of damaging your gums.Too acidic for gums.But keeps the plaques away. In addition, the packaging was also not enough. The box was damaged. Thanks to amazon they processed the refund. I guess it will be credited in my account in 1-2 days. Doesn't feel freshness after using it. Seams dublicate product. Someone mentioned that Listerine Mouthwash is a hedonic product, but I'm not sure as it isn't "pleasant". If you're using a good toothpaste, you really don't need to use this despite what all it claims as a good toothpaste would surely do all of that. Of course,or some other exceptional reason. I won't be able to use toothpaste for an unspecified time and so I decided to brush (without toothpaste) and then use this. But this has a few problems. First of all, rinsing it after 30 seconds may cause some burning sensation. However, that's not too painful. In product description, it's mentioned that for best results, one shouldn't rinse mouth with water or eat and drink anything for 30 minutes post rinse. As it contains alcohol, it's not advisable to swallow it. I find that particularly inconvenient. Colgate Plax claims to have 0% alcohol and cause no burning sensation, so if that's true, I may go for it next time (although it's relatively expensive). Wish I'd done the research before! Hope that I can start using paste again soon. Have to use the 3 bottles though as it's not returnable. As a pack of 3 was cheaper than buying just one, I wisely bought what seemed to be cheaper! How was I supposed to know, right?! Products not up to mark... Can smell better.. waste. I have been using Listerine mouth wash for years. thought i was getting a good deal here but the product seems a bit off. It tastes different. okay okay.. not good that as expected. I dislike it. It cuts the tongue and whole mouth. The media could not be loaded.I have been using Listerine mouth wash for quite some time and I know how it feels in my mouth (that's what she said). Listerine (not this product), whatever variant it maybe be, has a strong burning sensation. You can feel the alcohol at work if you use the original product. This pack of three mouthwash is so mellow you can clearly feel the difference. Tried scanning the QR code on the bottle, it's not even a QR code, just looks like one. I normally buy it from offline retail stores and the previous pack of three I bought from a Switch Kart (read between the lines), and it felt normal, how the original feels. I would just say Amazon should take a look into it and verify if original products are being sold to the customers. Weird smell maybe because of alcohol. My previous had no alcohol. So the switch was bad and worse is I bought the bottles. Creates bubble in mouth. Quality is not good. Go for cavity fighter. Bad and irritating taste I opened yesterday .Have to return the the product. Taste is very poor didn't like it.  Please check it all details care full return not able fir this product Tastes like kerosene….bad experience Maybe we received wrong products , it’s doesn’t give freshness The day when I used this it was very pathetic..my whole mouth had sore and now I am not satisfied with this mouth wash and even feeling disappointed for using this all the three not came on my usage becoz for more than two weeks I was in pain and I never recommend this to anyone becoz of very strong which burns my mouth I am using this Listerine product more than 3 years but when I have order list in Amazon the taste of Listerine is like horrible it's totally difficult when we pore into the mouth I am sure I'll be going to expose this product in media I think this is fake product Amazon has to be take care of this and if possible you can give a call to me
